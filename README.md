Shiny Dashboard - Business Dynamism Across the 50 States

This dashboard measures American business dynamismâ€“a crucial input for job creation. All data is sourced from the U.S. Census Business Dynamics Statistics Survey.

Chart 1 measures business creation rate, or the share of all firms that are 1 year old or younger. Chart 2 measures business creation rate against job creation rate from these new businesses, looking at where young companies are able to quickly grow in their first year. Chart 3 measures job reallocation rate, the sum of all jobs created and destroyed - looking at how quickly jobs move from shrinking to expanding firms.
